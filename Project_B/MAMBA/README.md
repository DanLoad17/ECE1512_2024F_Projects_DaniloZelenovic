Please note that this was created within a virtual environment, but the requirements.txt file is available, but this may still result in issues. Please run first the files that include the dataset download and metadata download. Then finally, the main.py file is the one that executes the project. Model.py was taken (with credit within the report) from the mamba-minimal GitHub. It is not my own.
