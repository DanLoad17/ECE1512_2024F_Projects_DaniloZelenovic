please note that the files for part (b) should not be used. they did not
properly incorporate the attention matching algorithm. instead, the file
for part 3 of task 1 for each dataset does that portion, in addition to
what was asked of it with using a different network. It displays both results.
However, perhaps it is more accurate and functions as intended than just looking
at the results from part 3. The issue is it is uncertain if it was implemented
as well as hoped in the files MNISTb and MHISTb.
